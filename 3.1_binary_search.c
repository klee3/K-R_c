/*
 * Performance Comparison Report: Original vs Modified Binary Search
 *
 * Summary:
 * -----------
 * The modified binary search algorithm reduces the number of conditional checks
 * inside the loop by using a single test instead of two, theoretically
 * improving efficiency. However, benchmark results show that the modified
 * version runs slightly slower than the original.
 *
 * Observed Results:
 * -----------------
 * Original Parallel runtime: ~31.8 seconds
 * Modified Parallel runtime: ~34.0 seconds
 *
 * Analysis:
 * ----------
 * 1. Branch Prediction:
 *    - The original binary search uses multiple conditional branches which
 * modern CPUs can predict accurately due to predictable data patterns.
 *    - The modified version defers the equality check to after the loop, which
 * might lead to less predictable branching and more mispredictions, causing CPU
 * pipeline stalls.
 *
 * 2. Extra Comparison After Loop:
 *    - The modified search performs an additional equality check outside the
 * loop, introducing extra instructions that accumulate over billions of
 * iterations.
 *
 * 3. Compiler Optimization:
 *    - Compilers can optimize the original loop more aggressively due to
 * straightforward control flow.
 *    - The modified versionâ€™s control flow might prevent some optimizations.
 *
 * 4. Cache and Memory Behavior:
 *    - Differences in memory access patterns and cache utilization can impact
 * performance.
 *    - The slight difference in code logic might cause subtle cache misses
 * affecting timing.
 *
 * Conclusion:
 * ------------
 * While fewer comparisons inside a loop might intuitively seem faster,
 * actual performance depends on CPU architecture, branch prediction,
 * compiler optimizations, and memory access patterns.
 *
 * This experiment highlights the complexity of performance tuning:
 * Optimizing for fewer instructions doesn't always translate into better
 * runtime.
 *
 * Recommendations:
 * -----------------
 * - Use compiler optimization flags (e.g., -O3 or -Ofast) when benchmarking.
 * - Run multiple trials and average results for more reliable data.
 * - Profile with tools like `perf` or `valgrind` to understand CPU and memory
 * behavior.
 * - Consider parallelization to fully utilize CPU cores for heavy workloads.
